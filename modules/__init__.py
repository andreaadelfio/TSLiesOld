TSLies: Time Series Anomaly Detection Framework - Core Modules

This package contains the core modules for time series anomaly detection:
- background: Machine learning models for background/trend prediction
- trigger: Generic anomaly detection algorithms (FOCuS, change point detection)
- utils: Utility functions and classes for data handling
- plotter: Visualization tools for time series and anomalies
- config: Configuration management system
- dataset: Generic data loading and preprocessing utilities

TSLies is domain-agnostic and can be applied to various time series data.
Domain-specific applications (like ACD data) are in the 'applications' package.
